{"name":"SNAC Saxon Extensions","tagline":"Saxon HE Extensions for use with SNAC","body":"Saxon HE Extensions for use with the SNAC project.  Includes Java parsers for human written dates and geographical names.  Serves as a sample for creating other extensions to Saxon without the built-in Saxon libraries.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nJavaDoc documentation is available [here](http://deternitydx.github.io/SNAC-Saxon-Extensions/javadoc/ \"JavaDoc Documentation\").\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n### Java Dependencies\r\n\r\nThe following JAR files are required to build and run the date and GeoNames parser extensions.  Using the links below, download and unzip (as necessary) the JAR files into a common place:\r\n\r\n* We provide extensions to Saxon HE, so you must install the full Saxon library. Saxon 9.5+ HE (the free version of Saxon) can be downloaded from the [Saxon website](http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/ \"Saxon Download Page\").\r\n* Compiling the code with the Java date parser extension requires the Apache Commons Library to handle some date-parsing functionality.  Apache Commons is made freely available [here](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/download_lang.cgi \"Apache Commons\").\r\n* The GeoNames parsing extension requires Berkeley's Cheshire to be installed.  Our extensions can be compiled and run without Cheshire, but the GeoNames portion will not function without it.  See the Cheshire Install instructions below to get Cheshire fully up and running with GeoNames.\r\n\r\n### Installing\r\n\r\nTo install the Saxon extensions, you need only download and compile our source code.  We provide an ant script to aid in compilation.  This may be completed with the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Download the SNAC Saxon Extensions (link at the top of the page) and unzip\r\n2. Download and unzip the Saxon 9.5+ HE JAR files\r\n3. Download and unzip the Apache Commons JAR files\r\n4. Download and install the latest Java JDK.  On an Ubuntu Linux system, this may be achieved using the following command: `sudo apt-get install default-jdk ant`.\r\n5. Compile extensions into executable JAR file.  The easiest way to install is using our Apache Ant script.  Copy the Saxon and Commons JAR files to the `/java/lib` folder in `SNAC-Saxon-Extensions`, then run `ant` as follows:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    > cd SNAC-Saxon-Extensions/java\r\n    > cp /path/to/saxon9he.jar lib/saxon9he.jar\r\n    > cp /path/to/commons-lang3-3.x.jar lib/commons-lang3.jar\r\n    > ant\r\n    ```\r\n6. Once the JAR file is built, execute using the new JAR file instead of the original Saxon saxon9he.jar file. For example: `java -jar snacTransform.jar /path/to/XMLfile /path/to/XSLTfile`\r\n  \r\n\r\nUsing the new Saxon extensions\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Date Parser\r\nSee the xslt/date.xsl file for a sample.  The xslt wrappers for the Java methods are available in xslt/lib/.\r\n\r\n### GeoNames Parser\r\nSee xslt/place.xsl for a sample on how to use the parsing library.  The xslt wrappers for the Java methods are available in xslt/lib/.\r\n\r\nInstalling Cheshire\r\n-----------------------\r\nCheshire is more complicated to install and set up as a service on your machine.  The instructions below are provided for Linux users.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
